# 5th week of the 2nd semester
Topics: Algorithms, Recursion, Collections and Complexity

###Readings:

* [Theory of algorithms & big-O notation](study/ComparingAlgorithms-ComplexityTheory.pdf)
* [How to measure execution time in Java](study/SestoftMicrobenchmarking.pdf)

##Day 1 - Collections and efficiency
The goal is to get an understanding of how one views efficiency of computer programs. 

* [Exercises](study/day1exercises.md)

##Day 2 - Recursion & binary trees
The goal is to be able to work with recursion - and in particular exemplified by binary trees

##Day 3 - Recursive sorting algorithms
Sorting is one of the most important fundamental issues in computing - we will look at some of the recursive sorting algorithms.

##Day 4 - Recap & Database indexing
Today we will work on a few more algorithms and datastructures to ground the previous few days.

##Day 5 - Studypoint exercise
(No presense required)
