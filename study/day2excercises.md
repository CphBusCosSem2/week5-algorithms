#Day2 Exercises - binary trees and recursion

1. Go to <https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BST.html> and play a bit with the animation. 
  Insert a few elements. Find an element, Delete an element.
2. Sketch a binary search tree (on paper) after the insertion of the numbers [ 5,3,2,6,8,9,10 ] in the order shown. 
   Assume that the tree was empty initially.
3. Sketch a (new) binary search tree after insertion of the numbers  [ -1,10,-50,-20,50,4,5,6 ].
4. Sketch a (new) binary search tree after insertion of the numbers [ 1,2,3,4,5,6 ]
5. Order the insertion of the numbers [1,2,3,4,5,6,7 ] into an empty tree, so that the 
resulting tree will have the minimal height possible.
6. Go to <https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/depth-first-traversals-of-binary-trees/934024358>. Try to figure out what is the difference between traversing the tree in Preorder, Inorder and Postorder.
7. State the order in which the nodes will be visited if the tree from exercise 4 is traversed following the principle inorder, preorder and postorder principle respectively.

  Import the class BinaryTree.java from the note* (**“Recursion and Binary Trees – demo code.zip” / Fronter**).
  * http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/110/BinaryTrees.html#java  (slightly modified)
   
8. Solve Binary Tree Problems 2-6 from Section 2 in the note*.
In each case provide the public method that the client should call and try it out - solutions can be found in the text.

9. Create the tree below using a sequence of calls to the insert menthod:
