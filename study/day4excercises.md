#Day 4 Exercises

##Exercise 1  (Collections class - efficiency)

Compare execution times for the method Collecions.sort() for two large collections

1.	ArrayList 
2.	LinkedList

Do you expect one of the collections to be sorted fastest?
Do your observations agree with your expectations?

Hint: Read the documentation for the implementation of the sort() method. In some versions of Java, the list is copied to an array before sorting. What does this imply for the execution times?  


##Exercise 2  (Utilizing Java Collection Framework)

Create an algorithm for eliminating duplicates from a list of elements (i.e. integers)
Consider whether any collection can be applied to simplify the task.


##Exercise 3  (Tree Sort)

Implement the tree sort algorithm by utilizing the Binary Tree class from a previous exercise.
 
Hint: You need to make some extensions to the Binary Tree class.
